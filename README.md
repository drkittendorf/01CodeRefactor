# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

I converted a number of div tags to Semantic HTML. These included: Header, Nav, Aside and Footer.

I reduced the amount of necessary CSS, reusing single section(s) of code rather than repeating identical effects through multiple class tags.

I added alt-tags to images that will replace the images in cases where they won't display properly.

I reordered the code so that it seems more intuitive (to me anyway), following the ordered flow of the page.

I added a title element, which helps with seo and appears in the tab of the web browser.

I eventually intend to switch the float elements out for flex box and add a CSS reset, but I lost time this week with computer problems and needed to move on.






## User Story
